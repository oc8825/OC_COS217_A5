information, and any source that you have used but not listed in the
authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction

Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

This was helpful for learning how the compiler works and to get
experience working in lower level languages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 2: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

It was helpful in learning assembly and the compiler, but annoying at 
times for sure



------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

Our part f gives the correct answer and runs quickly, but fails
boundary tests 9a, 9b, and 10. We had part f fully working without the
adcs optimization, but only failed these tests once adding the adcs
optimization. We kept the adcs optimization in because it is much
faster, but if we get more points for a fully correct but not as fast
part f, we would appreciate those points please. Thank you so much!

What is your mywc program test plan?

Boundary tests:
mywc1.txt: This is an empty file, testing the program's ability to 
only start counting words, characters, and lines once they start 
appearing
mywc2.txt: This is a file with just the character a, testing the 
program's functionality on very short inputs
mywc3.txt: This is a file with just the word "hello", testing the 
program's functionality on short inputs
mywc4.txt: This is a file with just the word "hello" and a newline,
testing the program's functionality on short inputs with newlines
mywc5.txt: This is a file with just the word "hello" and a space,
testing the program's functionality on short inputs with spaces but no
new lines
mywc6.txt: This contains only newlines, testing the program's ability
to count lines, even when there are no words present
mywc7.txt: This contains only spaces, testing the program's ability
to count spaces, even when there are no words present
mywc8.txt: This contains only tabs, testing the program's ability
to count other types of whitespace, even when there are no words
present
mywc9.txt: This contains a mix of whitespace types seperating the
words, testing the program's ability to recognize different types of
whitespace
mywc10.txt: This contains a mix of whitespace types and newlines,
testing the program's ability to recognize different types of
whitespace, including newlines
mywc11.txt: This contains one long word, testing the program's ability
to count characters correctly with no whitespace
mywc12.txt: This contains a single character word at the end, testing
the program's ending logic
mywc19.txt: This contains spaces before the first word and after the 
final word, testing the program's ability to maintain a proper word
count when spacing is used irregularly
mywc20.txt: This contains words with punctuation within them, testing
the program's ability to keep track of words (series of non
whitespace characters) when there are punctuation marks within them

Stress Tests: 
mywc13.txt: This contains a file with 1000 lines of words with a character
count of 47238 characters. It a stress test to see if the program can handle
large amounts of text, and was derived from a wikipedia text scraper
we developed in Python. 
mywc14.txt: This contains a file with 1000 lines of words with a character
count of 47488 characters. It a stress test to see if the program can handle
large amounts of text, and was derived from a wikipedia text scraper
we developed in Python. 
mywc15.txt: This contains a file with 1000 lines of words with a character 
count of 47428. It a stress test to see if the program can handle
large amounts of text, and was derived from a wikipedia text scraper
we developed in Python. 

Statement Tests: 
mywc16.txt: This is a statement test meant to test the following lines in 
the mywc.c file: 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 39, 42, 44, 45, 48, 49, 52, 53, 55, 56
mywc.17.txt: This is a statement test meant to test the following lines in 
mywc.c: 30, 32, 34, 36, 48, 49, 52, 55, 56
mywc18.txt: This is a statement test meant to test the following lines in 
the mywc.c file: 30, 32, 34, 42, 44, 45, 52, 53, 55, 56
